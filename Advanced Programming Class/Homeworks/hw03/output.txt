This is a word search program
I will display a word search puzzle
You will enter what words you want to find by entering them as command line arguments
I will tell you at what grid coordinates they start so you can start to notice them
For example the word Screen Lock starts at gamePuzzle[1][3] and runs horizontal
I will also display all the exact words to search for to run the program again.
