I will ask you for the coefficients for two lines
coefficients for these two equations
A1x +B1y + C1 = 0 and A2x + B2y + C2 = 0
I will compute the intersection point in the form of x0 and y0 values
I will also determin the angle in terms of degrees
Enter first equation
A1 : -3
B1 : 1
C1 : 3

Enter second equation
A2 : -2.3
B2 : 1
C2 : -4
x0 : 10.000000  y0 : 27.000000  angle : 44.635247
